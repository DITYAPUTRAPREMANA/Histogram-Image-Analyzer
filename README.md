# Histogram-Image-Analyzer
Features:
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter, users can easily upload images via a graphical interface.
- Grayscale Analysis: Calculates and visualizes the histogram of the image in grayscale. It also computes statistical measures including mean, variance, and standard deviation of intensity values.
- Color Analysis: For color images, the application separates and analyzes each RGB channel individually, displaying their histograms and corresponding statistics.
- Support for Multiple Formats: Accepts various image file types, including JPG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF.

Technical Stack:
-Python
-OpenCV (for image processing and histogram calculation)
-NumPy (for numerical operations)
-Matplotlib (for plotting histograms)
-Tkinter (for building the GUI)

Use Cases:
-Educational tool for learning image histogram analysis.
-Quick statistical analysis for image processing and computer vision tasks.
-Preprocessing step for image-based machine learning models.
